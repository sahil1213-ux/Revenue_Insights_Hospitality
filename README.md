# üìä AtliQ Grands: Business Intelligence Dashboard Project

## üß© Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands, a prestigious chain of five-star hotels across India, is facing a decline in market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel category. The downturn is due to increasing competition and poor strategic decision-making. In response, the management has decided to adopt Business and Data Intelligence practices to uncover actionable insights from historical data.

However, AtliQ Grands lacks an internal analytics team, leading them to seek external analytical services. As part of this initiative, a data analyst (you) has been tasked with building metrics, dashboards, and uncovering key insights to support data-driven decision-making.
